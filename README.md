# spotify-workshop

**ResBaz 2020 workshop**

Using data from Spotify, we'll encounter a data mining challenge and solve it using tricks from our machine learning toolkit. 

We'll learn about the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and its R wrapper, [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/), and explore data which are great for teaching, learning, and fun!

Topics: API, data preparation, model interpretability, feature engineering, clustering, dimensionality reduction, multiclass classification, supervised learning
